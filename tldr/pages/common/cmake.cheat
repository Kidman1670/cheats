# Generate a Makefile and use it to compile a project in the same directory as the source:

cmake && make

# Generate a Makefile and use it to compile a project in a separate "build" directory (out-of-source build):

cmake -H. -B<build> && make -C <build>

# Run cmake in interactive mode (it will ask for each variable, instead of using defaults):

cmake -i
